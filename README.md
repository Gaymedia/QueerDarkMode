## What is QueerDarkMode?

QueerDarkMode is a CSS file packaged as an extension for Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera, which wraps the community design of the German LGBTQ+ platform DBNA in a dark garb. The design can be used on the desktop as well as in the mobile version of DBNA.

## How can I install it?

Firefox and Opera users can easily install the addon using the following links:

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/queerdarkmode/

**Google Chrome users please proceed as follows:**
To install, simply download the contents of the repository and extract it to a location on your hard drive. Next you have to activate the developer mode under chrome://extensions/ in the upper right corner. Then you can select the folder with the data by clicking the button "Load unpacked extension" in the upper left corner. That's it.
