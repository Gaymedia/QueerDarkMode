## What is QueerDarkMode?

QueerDarkMode is an browser extension for Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera, which offers the possibility to change the community design of the german queer-social platform DBNA. The extension comes with two different dark designs, which can be switched between by clicking on the toolbar icon. Here the design can also be temporarily deactivated.

The design can be used on the desktop as well as in the mobile version of DBNA.
